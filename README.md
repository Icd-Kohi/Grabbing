# Drag & Drop Item Mini-Game
For you to practice dragging items on the floor/bag. 


### In-game footage:

- "Player is white, item is yellow"

![](/images/readme-img1.png "Player is white, item is yellow")

- "Item red indicates that Player can interact with it"

![](/images/readme-img2.png "Player can click the item")

- "Player throw the item"

![](/images/readme-img3.png "Player throw the item")

### TODOs:
1. *Inventory.*
2. *Inventory interaction.*
3. *Item x Inventory interaction.*
4. *Drag animation*
5. *Implement visual grid on the floor*
6. *Proper Assets to Player/Item*

   *(I'd rather do this project it in Godot)*
